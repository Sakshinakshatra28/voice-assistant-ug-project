# 🤖 Voice-Based Virtual Assistant (Offline + Online)

This is my final year UG project — a Python-based **Virtual Assistant** that works both **offline and online**, with a beautiful **Tkinter GUI** interface.

It responds to voice commands, plays local and YouTube songs, fetches weather, tells jokes, opens apps, and more — all from your voice!
